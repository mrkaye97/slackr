# slackr 3.2.2

* Fixes a bug where specifying specifying `duration` had no effect in `slackr_history()` if posted_from_time was not specified also. [linked issue](https://github.com/mrkaye97/slackr/issues/181)

# slackr 3.2.1

* Fixes a bug where specifying a `thread_ts` or `reply_broadcast` in `slackr` did nothing

# slackr 3.2.0

* `slackr` and `slackr_bot` no longer rely on `reprex`, as `prex_r` would fail when an eval environment needed to be specified, but couldn't.

# slackr 3.1.1

* `slackr_ims` bug fix.
* Using `usethis::use_pipe()` to import `{magrittr}`'s pipe.

# slackr 3.1.0

* Allows `ggslackr` to post multiple file types
* Fixes a bug in `slackr` and `slackr_bot` that led to garbled output

# slackr 3.0.1

Fixes to a couple of bugs
* Updated error handling for edge cases when you supply a username with a user token.
* Removes references to `purrr`, since it's GPL.
* Updates the vignettes

# slackr 3.0.0

Lots of breaking changes in this release:
* `bot_user_oauth_token` has been removed entirely in favor of `token`
* `slackr_history` now has `message_count` as it's first argument
* Adding the capability to pass the `thread_ts` parameter to all `slackr_*` functions (i.e. allowing you to reply to a message in a thread)
* Adding `reply_broadcast` capability in `slackr` and `slackr_msg`
* Adding `title` and `initial_comment` parameters for all functions relying on the `files.upload` endpoint (basically everything except for `slackr`, `slackr_bot`, `slackr_msg`, `slackr_history`, and `slackr_delete`)
* `slackr` and `slackr_bot` now use `reprex::prex()` in the background, which means that they no longer throw errors the same way as they did before. `slackr` will try to be helpful in telling you what went wrong if your `prex` output contains an error (instead of posting), but it isn't guaranteed to work all of the time. You can prevent this behavior by setting the `SLACKR_ERRORS` environment variable to `"IGNORE"`.

Other changes:
* Significant improvements to documentation, which now aligns with Slack API descriptions
* Significant internal overhauls of how the functions call the API

# slackr 2.4.1

* Small bug fix for `ggslackr`

# slackr 2.4.0

* Deprecates the `bot_user_oauth_token` argument for `slackr*` functions in favor of `token`
* Allows users to choose between a user token and a bot token
* Uses `withr::local_options(list(cli.num_colors = 1))` inside of `slackr` to fix garbled tibble printing. [linked issue](https://github.com/mrkaye97/slackr/issues/152)
* Removes the `channel`, `username` and `icon_emoji` parameters for `slackr_bot()` which were deprecated in version `2.1.1` and have no effect
* Removes the `cacheChannels` parameter for `slackr_setup()` which was deprecated in version `2.1.0`
* Removes hard-coded locale settings. [linked issue](https://github.com/mrkaye97/slackr/issues/154)
* Small error handling improvements and other miscellaneous fixes


# slackr 2.3.0

# slackr 2.2.0

* Gets rid of the usage of `slackr_chtrans()` in the vast majority of functions, significantly speeding up `slackr_***()` by limiting API requests

# slackr 2.1.3

* Fixes a `memoise` bug that was causing `slackr_chtrans()` to fail with `memoise < 2.0.0`

# slackr 2.1.2

# slackr 2.1.1

* Changes a few badly-set function default channels to be `Sys.getenv('SLACK_CHANNEL')` instead of `''`
* Adds a more informative error message on `slackr_upload()` when the request returns `not authed` as per #137
* Deprecates some arguments in `slackr_bot()` that no longer work (username, channel, icon emoji) that used to work with the old API structure

# slackr 2.1.0

* HTTP Caching speeds up requests and limits the number of requests we need to make
* `slackr_history()` and `slackr_delete()` are now implemented
* `username` and `icon_emoji` parameters to `slackr_***` functions now work again
* [https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/articles/webhook-setup.html](https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/articles/webhook-setup.html) have been added with setup instructions and usage
* Improved error messaging
* Updates to the README and the [pkgdown site](https://mrkaye97.github.io/slackr/)
* A number of significant back-end changes, thanks to [Andrie de Vries](https://github.com/andrie), including significant code cleanup, simplification of the API calls, pagination, and more!
