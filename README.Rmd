`slackr` provides a set of tools for making it easier to send messages, data, alerts, etc. directly from R to Slack. 
You can use this package to send well-formatted output from R to all teammates (or to specific individuals) at the same time 
with little effort. You can send text, R function output, images 
from the current graphics device and `ggplots`, R objects (as R data files), 
rendered LaTeX expressions, and uploaded files.

## Installation

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
# CRAN version
install.packages("slackr")

# Development version
devtools::install_github("mrkaye97/slackr")
```


## Breaking Changes

Version `3.0.0+` removes all references to `bot_user_oauth_token` (deprecated in `v2.4.0`) in favor of `token`. There have also been significant changes to how `slackr` and `slackr_bot` handle errors. See [the changelog](https://matthewrkaye.com/slackr/news/index.html) for more details.

Version `2.4.0+` now allows users to choose between using a bot token and a user token. See below for details and check the changelog (`NEWS.md`) for more changes.


## Setup

There are three ways of interfacing with `slackr` that provide
significantly different functionality:

1. Creating a single-channel bot

    Using only a webhook to send messages to a channel


2.  Creating a fully-functional multi-channel bot

    Creating a bot user to send messages to multiple channels, including plots,
tables, files, etc. as well as deleting messages, reading the channels in a
workspace, etc.

3.  Using a user token to send messages from a specific user's account

    Similar to the fully-scoped bot token, but connected to the account of a single user. This approach is not recommended in production settings -- or any settings where a token needs to be shared -- but it can be useful for one-off Slack messages as it lets users send data as themselves as opposed to through a bot.
    
In most cases, we recommend `Option 1` above. This requires the fewest
permissions and is the simplest to set up, and will allow basic messaging to a
specific channel.

See the vignettes for setup instructions.


## Vignettes

The vignettes contain setup instructions and example usage:

* Option 1 setup: `vignette('scoped-bot-setup', package = 'slackr')`
* Option 2 setup: `vignette('webhook-setup', package = 'slackr')`
* Usage: `vignette('using-slackr', package = 'slackr')`

**Important Note:** The setup process for `Option 2` and `Option 3` are roughly the same, with only slightly differing scopes.

### Config File Setup

The `slackr_setup()` function will try to read setup values from a `~/.slackr` 
(you can change the default filepath by recording in the SLACKR_CONFIG_FILE_PATH 
environment variable or supplying as an argument to the `config_file` 
parameter) configuration file, which may be easier and more secure than passing 
them in manually (plus, will allow you to have multiple `slackr` configurations 
for multiple Slack.com teams).

The file is in Debian Control File (DCF) format since it really doesn't need to
be JSON and R has a handy `read.dcf()` function since that's what `DESCRIPTION`
files are coded in.

Here's the basic format for the configuration file:

```
token: xox*-<your app's token>
channel: #general
username: slackr
incoming_webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX
icon_emoji: 'boom'
```

**As of `slackr 2.3.0`, you can create a config file with `create_config_file()` instead of setting it up manually.** See the docs for details.

You can also change the default emoji icon (from the one you setup at
integration creation time) with `icon_emoji`.

## Known Issues

* Depending on your scopes, `slackr` could quietly fail (i.e. not throw an error, but also not post anything to your channel). If this happens, try explicitly adding the app you're trying to have `slackr` post as to the channel you want in your Slack workspace with `/invite @your_app_name` or make sure you have `chat:write.public` enabled.
